          The detailed methodology revealed where Gen-AI currently excels ‚Äî primarily
          in <strong>code generation</strong> and communication layers ‚Äî and where it still
          struggles, like component self-identification.  
          The balance between software depth and hardware feasibility defined project focus.

        <p>
          The Ollama-based LLMs outperformed fine-tuned ones due to their pre-trained
          diversity. Fine-tuning Mistral-7B required larger, cleaner datasets to surpass
          baseline models.  
          The benchmark introduced a ‚Äúfocus factor‚Äù ‚Äî how closely model outputs followed
          a required JSON format.

          The prototype robot validated the central hypothesis: <strong>AI can bridge
          digital and physical spaces</strong>. The CGA dynamically generated executable
          code, ran it on the robot, and responded to user voice commands in real-time.
